# Pre-landing checks

Run these before landing on micro. Each one is a permanent regression test
for a bug that was fixed: it failed before the fix and passes after. Add
your fix's test here when you land it (one entry: what it guards, then the
command). Most of `tests/` is ad hoc; this list is not.

Run from the repository root. First export
`TMPDIR=/home/doc/cubit-build-tmp`, then use `nix develop`. Native builds
and headless runs hold the shared build lock
(`flock /home/doc/git/cubit/coordination/build.lock …`) and use
`--accel kvm`. Build first with `make -C kernel world`, plus any target an
entry names.

Some entries land from other branches. An entry whose files are not in
your tree yet is skipped until they are.

## startup-health (CAP-003)

The full desktop boots with no refusal:
- every service registers;
- Files', the Calculator's and Desktop's records reach logstore, so their
  publishers are bound;
- Desktop reads its configured `gpu.power.waitboost`;
- netmgr reads its declared `net.` scope.

It fails on any refused startup entry, Config key, log badge or launch
(`tests/headless/check-refusals.py`). See
docs/declaration-checking.md.

```sh
make -C kernel world boot-logs
bash tests/headless/run.sh --test startup-health --accel kvm --timeout 90
```

## logs (CAP-003)

The Logs app shows logstore's records, and nothing is refused on the way.
The profile used to start timesync without network approval, so procmgr
refused its required "ntp" entry; now any refusal fails the test
(`tests/headless/check-refusals.py`).

```sh
bash tests/headless/run.sh --test logs --accel kvm
```

## fs-coherence (FS-022)

Filesystem data and metadata stay coherent across writers.

```sh
bash tests/fs-coherence/build-cubit.sh && bash tests/fs-coherence/run-cubit.sh 3
```

## filesystem-hosted

The filesystem's hosted (Linux) suite.

```sh
bash tests/filesystem-hosted/run.sh
```

## filesystem-stack-frames

The filesystem server's stack frames stay within their bound.

```sh
bash tests/filesystem-stack-frames/check.sh
```

## tls-roots

The TLS trust store's roots load and verify.

```sh
bash tests/tls-roots/check.sh
```

## config-storage (CFG-002)

Config persistence through config-storage: the startup table reaches its
Rust entry, and its requests carry the worker badge.

```sh
bash tests/headless/run.sh --test config-storage --accel kvm
```

## config-objects-reopen

Typed Config collections survive a restart of the store.

```sh
bash tests/headless/run.sh --test config-objects-reopen --accel kvm
```
