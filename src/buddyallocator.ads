-- @summary Physical Memory Manager
--
-- @description Implementation of a Buddy Allocator using free lists organized
-- by block order, where block size = FRAME_SIZE * (2 ^ Order).
-- 
-- The CuBit physical memory manager works on blocks strictly
-- aligned by their size. This has some tradeoffs. We lose some memory to
-- external fragmentation if a usable area does not start at a multiple of our
-- largest block size, i.e. if we're using a MAX_BUDDY_ORDER of 10, our largest
-- block is 4MiB. If a memory area starts at 1MiB, we'd lose 3MiB prior to the
-- 4MiB boundary before we can allocate memory starting at the 4MiB mark. The
-- worst-case scenario would be a memory area starting at <4MiB and ending at
-- <8MiB. This allocator will not use this memory.
--
-- The advantages to this scheme are two-fold. One, we can use power-of-2
-- addresses with only a single shift and xor to do buddy/parent calculations,
-- which is faster than doing arithmetic on page frame numbers. Two, all
-- allocations yield pages which are strictly aligned by their block size, with
-- no additional accounting required when aligned blocks are needed.
--
-- If on a memory-constrained system, it benefits the user to use a smaller
-- value for Config.MAX_BUDDY_ORDER to minimize memory losses outside of these
-- aligned boundaries.
--
-- NOTE: Explicitly storing addresses here is probably not the most
-- Ada-standard way of doing things, but it makes the arithmetic easier without
-- a bunch of Address_to_Access conversions, etc. Using explicit placement
-- with Import is much more straightforward.
--
-- CAUTION: Theoretically, a malicious user program could put the address
--  of our buddy in the buddy offset of a page that's mapped, and when the
--  buddy is freed, it would coalesce with a block that's owned by the
--  user. It's unlikely that a user would be able to guess the physical
--  page he's on, nor what size block was allocated, but it is still a
--  risk. This is mitigated in other systems by maintaining a separate
--  bitmap for the frame usage, but the bitmaps grow quite large.
--
--  One technique to mitigate the risk is to always give user processes
--  two smaller buddies, rather than a single larger block. 
--
--  CuBit wouldn't try and free either buddy until they are
--  both no longer mapped to the process. The only time it would use
--  extra memory is for MAX_BUDDY_ORDER or order 0 allocations.
--
--  Obviously there comes a point where the excess memory given to
--  processes may outweigh the memory used by the bitmaps. Likely, it's
--  probably irrelevant, as the greedy process just ends up having to ask
--  us for memory less frequently.
-- 
--  Another option is to check whether the buddy being freed is mapped to a
--  process, but this could be expensive. Or, we just add bitmaps.
--
-- NOTE: This package makes no use of dynamic memory allocation at this time,
--  and could theoretically be used as the boot allocator, however that may
--  change later if we add bitmaps or other lists representing the state of
--  physical frames.
--
-- CAUTION: This allocator builds its free lists in the virtual, linear-mapped
--  memory range. All the internal addresses it uses are going to be
--  higher-half. The addresses it returns are using a conversion to
--  a physical address.
