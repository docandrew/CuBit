--  This package provides support for assertions (including pragma Assert,
--  pragma Debug, and Precondition/Postcondition/Predicate/Invariant aspects
--  and their corresponding pragmas).

--  This unit may be used directly from an application program by providing
--  an appropriate WITH, and the interface can be expected to remain stable.
